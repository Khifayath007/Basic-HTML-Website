<h2>Single Page CV using HTML</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to guide you through creating a structured, single-page CV (Curriculum Vitae) using only HTML. The focus of this project is on building a clean, semantic layout that effectively organizes key sections of a CV such as your education, skills, and career history. You will be introduced to the concept of structuring a document using HTML tags without any styling or design elements.

The goal is to ensure that you understand how to use HTML to create an organized and accessible CV, with an emphasis on clear, readable structure. The sections will be laid out in a way that makes it easy to add styling in the future, but for now, you will only work on building the core structure.

Project Requirements:
Create a single-page CV using only HTML.
Organize the CV into meaningful sections, such as:
Header: Your name and contact information.
Education: A list of your academic achievements.
Skills: A section outlining your core skills.
Career History: A detailed list of your past job roles and experiences.
Ensure the layout is semantic and clean.
Focus on using appropriate HTML tags for each section (e.g., header, section, article, etc.).
The purpose of this project is not to style the CV, but to focus entirely on how to structure it using HTML in a way that is semantic, accessible, and easy to style later on. Youâ€™ll learn how to build a strong HTML foundation that will be useful for future projects involving more advanced styling and design.

    <h2>HTML Only Portfolio</h2>
    <p>The objective of this project is to help you learn how to structure a website using HTML. The focus will be on creating the different sections of a website, such as the header, footer, navigation, main content, and sidebars, without any styling. Styling will be addressed in a separate project. 

        In this task, you are required to build a simple HTML-only website consisting of multiple pages, which include:

        - Homepage
        - Projects
        - Articles
        - Contact

        Each page should have a navigation bar that appears consistently across all pages, linking to all the other pages within the website.

        Goals: 
        1. Learn how to create multiple pages for a website.
        2. Understand how to structure a website using HTML in a semantic and organized way.
        3. Ensure the structure is easily adaptable for styling in the future.
        4. Implement SEO-friendly meta tags in the HTML structure.

        This project requires you to focus solely on structuring the HTML without any CSS styling. Follow the mockup example for guidance, but remember that the focus is on creating the foundational structure to support styling later on.
