# Simple HTML Website Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help you learn how to structure a website using HTML. The focus is entirely on building the structure of a website without adding any styling. Styling will be done in separate projects. In this project, you will:

- Learn to create multiple pages in a website.
- Structure the website in a semantic way using HTML.
- Ensure that the structure is easily styleable in future projects.
- Add SEO meta tags to enhance the website’s visibility.

## Project Requirements
You are required to create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages. The website should have the following pages:
1. **Homepage**
2. **Projects**
3. **Articles**
4. **Contact**

### Key Features:
- **Navigation Bar**: 
  - The navigation bar should be present on all pages and provide links to all the pages of the website.
  - The links in the navigation bar should be functional and allow easy movement between pages.
  
- **No Styling Required**: 
  - The focus of this project is on the structure. No CSS or other styling is required at this stage.
  
- **SEO Meta Tags**: 
  - Add basic SEO meta tags to improve the website’s search engine visibility.

## Pages Breakdown:
1. **Homepage**: 
    - This is the landing page that provides an introduction to the website.
  
2. **Projects**: 
    - A page that lists projects, which can be structured as a list of projects with descriptions.
  
3. **Articles**: 
    - A section that lists articles or blog posts, structured similarly to the projects page.
  
4. **Contact**: 
    - A page with a basic contact form structure (no functionality needed).

## How to Get Started
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Create a folder for the website and structure the files for each of the pages (e.g., `index.html`, `projects.html`, `articles.html`, `contact.html`).
3. Add SEO meta tags in the `<head>` section of each page.
4. Ensure the navigation bar is consistent across all pages and links to each page.
5. Test the navigation by moving between pages.
